* webpack

* securing api key with .env

## Description
Currency exhange application:

    A user should be able to enter an amount (in U.S. dollars), then specify another currency and submit a form. The user should then see the total amount they entered in converted currency. For example, a user might enter 10 dollars and then see that amount in South Korean won.
    Users should be able to convert U.S. currency into at least 5 other types of currency.
    If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification to the user that states what the error is (in the DOM). 
    If the query response doesn't include that particular currency, the application should return a notification that states the currency in question doesn't exist.
